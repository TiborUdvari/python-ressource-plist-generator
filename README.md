# python-ressource-plist-generator
Script used to generate a plist file of ressources in the current folder to be references in an iOS project.

This is useful if you have images in a folder, that you may wish to use, but do not want to resort to a namig convention, nor use the filesystem. 

This way you may just copy your files in an `.xcassets` folder to take advantage of the optimisations and still be able to have a list of your ressources.
